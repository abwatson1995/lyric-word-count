<p1><strong>Lyric Word Count</strong></p>

<p>This JAVA program uses a hashmap to count the occurences of each words that appears in a set of song lyrics.</p>

<p>The program uses a hashmap of the form ```<b>HashMap<String, Integer> wordCount = new HashMap<String, Integer>()``` where <i>String</i> represents the word, and <i>Integer</i> represents the numeric value for each word.</p>

<p>The attraction of using the HashMap is that by using a String key and an Integer value, each String, or key, can be stored, and their value, or count, incremented by determining if a given key already exists, and simply incrementing its value.</p>
