<p1>Lyric Word Count<p1>

<p>This JAVA program uses a HashMap to count the occurences of each words that appears in Ariana Grande's song <quote>Thank U, Next</quote>.</p>

<p>The program uses a HashMap of the form
  
  ```java
  HashMap<String, Integer> wordCount = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
  ```
where ```String</i>``` represents the word, and ```Integer``` represents the numeric value for each word.
</p>

<p>The attraction of using the HashMap is that by using a ```String``` key and an ```Integer``` value, each String can be stored, and a tally of its occurence incremented by determining if a given key already exists, and simply incrementing its value.</p>

<!-- I didn't do the visualization part, that info goes here where I get around to it--!>

<!-- think about some things youd change - think in terms of effenciency, methods youd use instead of cramming everything into one long program --!>
